	title = {Wavelets on Graphs via Spectral Graph Theory},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3848},
	abstract = {We propose a novel method for constructing wavelet transforms of functions deﬁned on the vertices of an arbitrary ﬁnite weighted graph. Our approach is based on deﬁning scaling using the the graph analogue of the Fourier domain, namely the spectral decomposition of the discrete graph Laplacian L. Given a wavelet generating kernel g and a scale parameter t, we deﬁne the scaled wavelet operator Tgt = g({tL}). The spectral graph wavelets are then formed by localizing this operator by applying it to an indicator function. Subject to an admissibility condition on g, this procedure deﬁnes an invertible transform. We explore the localization properties of the wavelets in the limit of ﬁne scales. Additionally, we present a fast Chebyshev polynomial approximation algorithm for computing the transform that avoids the need for diagonalizing L. We highlight potential applications of the transform through examples of wavelets on graphs corresponding to a variety of diﬀerent problem domains.},

    abstract = {In applications such as social, energy, transportation, sensor, 
    and neuronal networks, high-dimensional data naturally reside on the 
    vertices of weighted graphs. The emerging ﬁeld of signal processing on 
    graphs merges algebraic and spectral graph theoretic concepts with 
    computational harmonic analysis to process such signals on graphs. In this 
    tutorial overview, we outline the main challenges of the area, discuss 
    different ways to deﬁne graph spectral domains, which are the analogues to 
    the classical frequency domain, and highlight the importance of 
    incorporating the irregular structures of graph data domains when 
    processing signals on graphs. We then review methods to generalize 
    fundamental operations such as ﬁltering, translation, modulation, dilation, 
    and downsampling to the graph setting, and survey the localized, multiscale 
    transforms that have been proposed to efﬁciently extract information from 
    high-dimensional data on graphs. We conclude with a brief discussion of 
    open issues and possible extensions.},

    title = {{GRAPH} {WAVELET} {NEURAL} {NETWORK}},
    abstract = {We present graph wavelet neural network ({GWNN}), a novel graph 
    convolutional neural network ({CNN}), leveraging graph wavelet transform to 
    address the shortcomings of previous spectral graph {CNN} methods that 
    depend on graph Fourier transform. Different from graph Fourier transform, 
    graph wavelet transform can be obtained via a fast algorithm without 
    requiring matrix eigendecomposition with high computational cost. Moreover, 
    graph wavelets are sparse and localized in vertex domain, offering high 
    efﬁciency and good interpretability for graph convolution. The proposed 
    {GWNN} signiﬁcantly outperforms previous spectral graph {CNNs} in the task 
    of graph-based semi-supervised classiﬁcation on three benchmark datasets: 
    Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.},
