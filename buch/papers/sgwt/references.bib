    shorttitle = {The Emerging Field of Signal Processing on Graphs},
    abstract = {In applications such as social, energy, transportation, sensor, 
    and neuronal networks, high-dimensional data naturally reside on the 
    vertices of weighted graphs. The emerging ﬁeld of signal processing on 
    graphs merges algebraic and spectral graph theoretic concepts with 
    computational harmonic analysis to process such signals on graphs. In this 
    tutorial overview, we outline the main challenges of the area, discuss 
    different ways to deﬁne graph spectral domains, which are the analogues to 
    the classical frequency domain, and highlight the importance of 
    incorporating the irregular structures of graph data domains when 
    processing signals on graphs. We then review methods to generalize 
    fundamental operations such as ﬁltering, translation, modulation, dilation, 
    and downsampling to the graph setting, and survey the localized, multiscale 
    transforms that have been proposed to efﬁciently extract information from 
    high-dimensional data on graphs. We conclude with a brief discussion of 
    open issues and possible extensions.},

@article{xu_graph_2019,
    title = {{GRAPH} {WAVELET} {NEURAL} {NETWORK}},
    abstract = {We present graph wavelet neural network ({GWNN}), a novel graph 
    convolutional neural network ({CNN}), leveraging graph wavelet transform to 
    address the shortcomings of previous spectral graph {CNN} methods that 
    depend on graph Fourier transform. Different from graph Fourier transform, 
    graph wavelet transform can be obtained via a fast algorithm without 
    requiring matrix eigendecomposition with high computational cost. Moreover, 
    graph wavelets are sparse and localized in vertex domain, offering high 
    efﬁciency and good interpretability for graph convolution. The proposed 
    {GWNN} signiﬁcantly outperforms previous spectral graph {CNNs} in the task 
    of graph-based semi-supervised classiﬁcation on three benchmark datasets: 
    Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.},

    abstract = {This paper develops the necessary tools to understand the 
    relationship between eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a graph and the 
    connectedness of the graph. First we prove that a graph has k connected 
    components if and only if the algebraic multiplicity of eigenvalue 0 for 
    the graph’s Laplacian matrix is k. We then prove Cheeger’s inequality (for 
    dregular graphs) which bounds the number of edges between the two subgraphs 
    of G that are the least connected to one another using the second smallest 
    eigenvalue of the Laplacian of G.},
